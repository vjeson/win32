A package that wraps some of the most common Win32 API calls using FFI to make
them accessible to Dart code without requiring a C compiler or the Windows SDK.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/win32.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/win32)
[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Dart-blue.svg)](https://dart.dev)

Perhaps of as much use as the APIs themselves, this package provides a variety of
instructive examples for more complex FFI usage scenarios.

By design, this package provides minimal modifications to the Win32 API to support
Dart idioms. The goal is to provide high familiarity to an existing Win32 developer.
Other plugins may build on these primitives to provide a friendly API for Dart and
Flutter developers. A good example of that is
[filepicker_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows), which offers a
common item dialog suitable for incorporation into an existing Flutter app.

## Requirements

This package assumes the [Dart 32-bit or 64-bit compiler](https://dart.dev/get-dart),
running on Windows.

## Usage

A simple Petzoldian Hello World example can be found in the `example`
subdirectory. This example demonstrates creating a Win32 window and responding
to common messages such as `WM_PAINT` through a `WindowProc` callback function.

To run it, type:

```
dart example\hello.dart
```

This should display a window with a text message.

This can be compiled into a standalone Win32 executable by running:

```
dart2native example\hello.dart -o example\bin\hello.exe
```

## Samples

### Dart samples

The package includes a number of examples in the `example` subdirectory. These
examples use the Win32 API for all UI display and do not require Flutter.

| Example            | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hello.dart`       | Basic Petzoldian "hello world" Win32 app                  |
| `paint.dart`       | Demonstrates simple GDI drawing and min/max window sizing |
| `scroll.dart`      | Example of horizontal and vertical scrolling text window  |
| `console.dart`     | Shows usage of console APIs                               |
| `msgbox.dart`      | Demonstrates a MessageBox from the console                |
| `calendar.dart`    | Gets information about the calendar from a WinRT API      |
| `sendinput.dart`   | Sends keyboard and mouse input to another window          |
| `knownfolder.dart` | Retrieves known folders from the current user profile     |
| `window.dart`      | Enumerates open windows and basic window manipulation     |
| `wallpaper.dart`   | Shows what wallpaper and background color are set         |
| `guid.dart`        | Creates a globally unique identifier (GUID)               |
| `devices.dart`     | Uses volume management APIs to list all disk devices      |
| `modules.dart`     | Enumerates all loaded modules on the current system       |
| `snake.dart`       | Snake game using various GDI features                     |
| `dialogshow.dart`  | Creates a common item dialog (file picker) using COM      |
| `wmi.dart`         | Using WMI from COM to retrieve device/OS information      |
| `winmd.dart`       | Interrogate Windows Runtime types                         |
| `dynamic_load.dart`| Demonstrate loading a DLL and calling it at runtime       |
| `tetris\main.dart` | Port of an open-source Tetris game to Dart                |
| `notepad\notepad.dart` | Lightweight replica of the Windows notepad applet     |

### Flutter samples

The `explorer\` subdirectory contains an example of a simple Flutter app that
uses the volume management Win32 APIs to find the disk drives connected to your
computer and their volume IDs and attached paths.

## Features and bugs

Let me know what APIs you're interested in seeing. I'm not planning to project
the entire Windows API, but I'm particularly interested in examples that either
unblock a plugin for Windows or that demonstrate more complex Windows APIs that
represent an important pattern.

Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue tracker][tracker]. This
is a hobby project, and should not be viewed as having the same level of
quality assurance as an official package from the Dart team. I'm a product
manager having fun on my weekends! 

## Acknowledgements

The Tetris example listed above is a fuller worked example of a reasonably
complete program that uses the Dart Win32 package. It is a port of a C version
of the game by Chang-Hung Liang. [More information...](tetris/README.md)

The [C implementation of the Snake game](https://github.com/davidejones/winsnake)
is by David Jones, and is ported with his permission.

Petzold, and is kindly [licensed by him](http://www.charlespetzold.com/faq.html)
